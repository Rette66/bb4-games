This package was originally meant to provide a framework for creating and experimenting with 2 player games with perfect information. However, it has expended to include multi-player games, and games other than those with perfect information.
You can use it to create new games or improve on old ones.
Even if you do not add new games, there are a variety of ways that you can extend and improve
all of the existing games by enhancing the shared common code.
For example, you can add new search strategies (see the game.twoplayer.common.search package)
or you can enhance the ui (see game.core.ui or bb4-ui) or optimization project (bb4-optimization) .
